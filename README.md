Hi, I’m Veenalim.

- I’m a health outcomes researcher with a focus on using data to improve healthcare insights and decision-making.
- I’m particularly interested in exploring automation tools and innovative approaches to make research processes more efficient.
- My current work involves analysing real-world data, such as patient registries, medical device data, and survey results, to generate meaningful evidence.
- On GitHub, I’m experimenting with ways to better analyse, visualise, and manage data.
